      <h1>About Me</h1>
      
        <p className='Me'>I have always enjoyed working with computers, but it wasn't until late highschool that I found out about programming and I knew instantly I wanted to persue it. 
          I am a fourth year student at Wilfrid Lauirer Univeresity studying Computer Science. I have learned a lot during my time here, but I know there is still so much more for me to learn.
          I still haven't regretted my decision of choosing computer science as my major, and am still as excited to learn as I was when I first learnt about it.
